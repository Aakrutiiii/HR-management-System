HR management System
It is desktop application which can  perform CRUD operations along with proper Validations and can create PDF of the list of employees and designation. 
It  has two modules Exployees and designation .
This project is created in java using Layered programming Including Data layer for data base storage, business layer to separate data base from User interface and presentation layer for UI/UX.
Speciality of this project is that we can change any  layer without affecting another layer.
I've added some snaps of the project UI.
